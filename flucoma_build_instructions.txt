This release just includes the  FluCoMa code compiled from source ([v1.0.6](https://github.com/flucoma/flucoma-sc/releases/tag/1.0.6)) to run on a Raspberry Pi 4 with a 32-bit os. It is possible this code will also run on other PIs (e.g. CM3, CM3+ and Pi3B+).

installation instructions
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider.git
git clone https://github.com/flucoma/flucoma-sc.git
cd flucoma-sc/
git checkout tags/1.0.6
mkdir build && cd build
export CXXFLAGS="-march=armv8-a -mfloat-abi=hard -mfpu=neon-fp-armv8"
cmake -DSC_PATH=</path/to/SuperCollider/source/code> -DFLUID_BRANCH=1.0.6 -march=armv8-a -mcpu=cortex-a72 -mabi=lp640 -UDOCS -DDOCS=OFF ..
make install
```

after installation is complete, move the files in the newly created `release-packaging` directory to the SuperCollider extensions (e.g. `mv release-packaging/* /usr/local/share/SuperCollider/Extensions/FluidCorpusManipulation`)

to confirm FluCoMa tools is installed correctly, in supercollider execute: `FluidDataSet.version;`
expected result: `Fluid Corpus Manipulation Toolkit: version 1.0.6+sha.386d174.core.sha.f694a366`

**important caveat**: i really don't know much about cmake and building code from source, and it is possible some of these steps aren't entirely correct and may need to be adjusted depending on the Raspberry PI used to build the code.
